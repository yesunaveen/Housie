4. If the number displayed is present on your ticket, please circle it.<BR>
5. The numbers that have already appeared, will be highlighted in green on the table at the bottom-left hand corner of the page. So even if you join in late, you can see the older numbers, mark your ticket and continue participating in the game.<BR>

1.<b> A player can't win more than 1 prize. If a player has already won a prize, he can't claim another prize, but can play for a FULL HOUSE.</b>(We want maximum number of people to win prizes:)<BR>
2. <b>If a player claims that he/she has won a particular prize, then they need to present their ticket to the ORGANISER who will check his/her claim by matching his/her ticket with all the numbers already displayed.</b> If it is found that a player claiming a specific prize was false, then his/her ticket is a BOOGY i.e. <u>this ticket cannot play further.</u><BR>
3. <b>In cases of a tie, where two or more claimants for the same prize, arrive at the ORGANISERS room <u>BEFORE</u> the next number is called out, the prizes will be split equally. If they come after the next number is out then it will be on the First come First served basis.</b><BR>
